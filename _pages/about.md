I am a [postdoctoral fellow](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/robin-rohl%C3%A9n) within the Neuroengineering group at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Lund University, Sweden. I am also [affiliated](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/robin-rohlen/) with the Department of Radiation Sciences, Ume√• University, Sweden, where I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering in January 2022 ([thesis](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:umu:diva-187016) defence in September 2021).

My research interests are developing methods and algorithms for identifying and analysing motor unit activity using ultrasound and electromyography, mainly using advanced ultrasound imaging with great spatial and temporal resolution through a programmable ultrasound research system.
