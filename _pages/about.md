I am a [postdoctoral fellow](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/robin-rohl%C3%A9n) within the [Neuroengineering group](https://bme.lth.se/research-pages/neuroengineering/neuroengineering/) at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Lund University, Sweden. I am also [affiliated](https://www.umu.se/en/staff/robin-rohlen/) with the Department of Radiation Sciences, Umeå University, Sweden, where I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering.

My research interests are developing methods and algorithms for identifying and analysing motor unit activity using ultrasound and electromyography. Particularly using advanced ultrasound imaging with great spatial and temporal resolution through the use of a programmable ultrasound research system.
